Portfolio Website

I have put together this portfolio website to display my skills as a Full Stack Web Developer.

My code is written primarily in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

To get the program to work after dowloading all the files, run the index.html file in a web browser.

Contributers may submit a pull request on Github from a forked repository.

Credits to Jeffrey Owens and the team at Udacity.com for teaching me these skills
